Lyrion can stream your local music collection, internet radio stations, and content from many streaming services.
In a LMS system, there will need to be server software running on a controlling computer or device, 
and one or more music players connected to it.

Squeezer acts as a remote control for these players.
It works by connecting to the server and selecting a player. Then sending commands to the server, which in turn sends
those commands to the player.
